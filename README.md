You can add books by pressing the *Add book*. There you can search for your book or add the book manually. The books displayed are provided by the Google Books API, so if you can't find a book is because they don't have it. <br> <br>

After you added your book you can start reading it. To count your readings you need to select de book you want to read and the page you reached. <br> <br>

  <img src="readmeImg/update.PNG" height="512" width="300">
</div> <br> <br>

Also, you can see books details by checking the library below Update Reading. Every book has a *Complete* button to finish the book, an *Edit* button to edit the total number of pages it has and last, but not least a *Stop reading* button.

This project had the purpose to help me learn how to use Firebase and also it was meant to have a bit more features like:
<br>
- [ ] *Friends* - the user would be able to follow other users and see their progress
- [ ] *Achivments* - an award system so the user feel more motivated to read
<br>
